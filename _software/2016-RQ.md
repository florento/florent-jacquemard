[RQ](http://repmus.ircam.fr/cao/rq) 
is an environement for rhythm quantization, 
integrated into the graphical programming environment 
[OpenMusic](http://repmus.ircam.fr/openmusic/home), 
a state of the art system in computer assisted music composition 
developed at and distributed by [Ircam](http://forumnet.ircam.fr/product/openmusic-en/).

The quantization procedure of RQ follows an interactive workflow, 
favouring user interactions in order to search for a satisfying balances 
between different criteria, 
in particular the precision of the transcription 
and the readability of the music score in outcome. 
It has been implemented via a dedicated graphical interface 
making it possible the interactive exploration of the space of quatization solutions
(rendered in music notation)
their visualization and their edition, with a particular focus on the processing of grace-notes and rests.

Most of the developpement of RQ was conducted by Adrien Ycart, at Ircam, 
in collaboration with Jean Bresson (main developper of OpenMusic)
and it has been evaluated by some composers and musicologists.
