- INRIA Exploratory Action  **Codex**   (2020-2023) on the formal representation and processing of symbolic music data, and applications to information retrieval in digital music score databases, computational musicology, music transcription and corpus digitization. The project is starting in November 2020 with the PhD of Lydia Rodriguez de la Nava.

- French national project **CollabScore** (ANR 2020-2023), aiming at the development of approaches for music score digitilization in semi-structured formats, with Optical Music Recognition (OMR) and methods for large scale collaborative correction and the valorization of music collections. It implies [Cedric](https://cedric.cnam.fr)/CNAM (coordinator), Irisa, [IReMus](https://www.iremus.cnrs.fr)/CNRS/SU, the [BnF](https://gallica.bnf.fr/) (French National Library), 2 libraries of [Fondation Royaumont](https://www.royaumont.com/fr/les-bibliotheques), and the company [Antescofo](https://www.antescofo.com).

- European H2020-SC6-TRANSFORMATIONS projet **Polifonia**  (2021-2024) *a digital harmoniser for musical heritage knowledge*. The objective of the project is to realise an ecosystem of computational methods and tools supporting discovery, extraction, encoding, interlinking, classification, exploration of, and access to, European musical heritage knowledge on the Web, and to demonstrate that these tools improve the state of the art of Social Science and Humanities methodologies. The partners are Alma Mater Studiorum, UniversitaÌ€ di Bologna (coordinateur), Open University, Stichting Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Insight Centre for Data Analytics, NUI Galway, Istituto Centrale del Catalogo e della Documentazione, Istituto Centrale per i Beni Sonori e Audiovisivi, IReMus/CNRS/SU, Cedric/CNAM, Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, Digital Paths srl.
