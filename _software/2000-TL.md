I have worked at the company [Trusted Logic](http://www.trusted-logic.fr), 
on the development and certification of software components for embeded systems, 
in particular smartcards and payment terminals.

More specificaly, I worked there on the 
conception of tools for the formal verification of Java and JavaCard programs, 
based on symbolic evaluation methods.

I was also involved in the development of an open multi-platform environment
for payment and mobile terminals,
with in particular the realization of 
* components of a HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) enabling the port of the environment  (to STIP profile terminals, FINREAD card readers and MIDP mobile terminals),
* some applications for terminals,
* a terminal simulator for running and debugging applets on a PC environment (Win32).
