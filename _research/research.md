My research project is concerned with  Computer Music and Digital Humanities, 
more specifically with the processing of structured music data (*digital music scores*), 
in particular I am currently working on the following problems:
<!---  
* the **creation** and **digitalisation** of music notation (assistance to composition and corpus captation), 
--->
* music **transcription** ,
* music score and corpus **analysis** (digital musicology), 
  and **melodic similarity** computation,
* **information retrieval** in bases of music scores.
<!--- 
with a current focus on the two following applications:
* automated music **transcription** and 
* the computation of **melodic similarity**.
--->
using on formal methods and tools from the following fundamental domains:
* automata and **tree automata** theory, **weighted** and unweighted, 
* **edit distances** between strings and trees, 
* logic in computer science, 
* term rewriting systems and automated deduction.

Formerly, I have worked on these formal methods and their application to the verification of systems and software:
* timed-testing of interactive music systems and Computer-Aided Composition at _Ircam Paris_,
* verification of web data management systems and computer security at _LSV/ENS-Cachan_, 
* automated deduction at _Inria Nancy_, _MPI-I Saarbr√ºcken_, _SRI International, Stanford_,
* development of secure embedded software components for smartcards and payment terminals at the company _Trusted Logic_.
