Maude is a declarative language based on Rewriting Logic,
developped by Steven Eker, 
under the direction of Jose Meseguer,
at S.R.I. International, Computer Science Laboratory, Palo Alto, CA, USA.

I implemented (C++) tree automata tools in the virtual machine of the language,
the the development of an inductive theorem prover in Maude thereafter.
