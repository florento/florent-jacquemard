- [poster] with Francesco Foscarin, Raphaël Fournier-S'Niehotta, Philippe Rigaux, at [DMRN+14](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/dmrn/dmrn-14/) Dec. 2019, Queen Mary University of London: “AMT for Musicians: Performed-MIDI-to-Score Transcription”.

- algorithms and tool for the comparison of music score files: identification and visualization of differences, similarly to the Unix diff tool for text files.
